# Gravity Forms Image Resize
Wordpress Plugin - Gravity Forms Add On to Resize Image Uploads

This Gravity Forms add on creates a setting on the Form Settings page that allows you to automatically resize form image uploads before they are stored on the server. Image sizes are set based on the standard Wordpress image sizes.

This add on works with Gravity Perks File Upload Pro.
